!! Saving Tiddler ...

it is quite easy to loose your modification while editing a tiddly in chrome
or other browser that doesn't allow "inplace" html save.

indeed a click on save, will simply download the file in %USERPROFILE%\Downloads

one solution is :
 using a wrapper that link the last downloaded file before opening it

.

I wrote a quick perl script for doing so, and placed it in the SendTo folder

so I can right-click on my-tiddler.html file -> SendTo -> EditTiddler

Voilà!



note: so far this is tested on Windows,
 if you'd like to port it for OSX or other OSes.
 we will be delighted you'd update the scripts and notify us when it is working 
 Thanks
